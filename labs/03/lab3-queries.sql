-- Hey TAs. These queries are blank.
-- I did this at the last minute unfortunately.

-- Running Linux and used MySQL Workbench to generate a Chen diagram.
-- Exported this diagram to an SQL script.

-- I am running MySQL 14.14 Distrib 5.7.27 and the generated SQL scripts are not compatible.
-- I don't have enough time to re-do these CREATE TABLE statements, so there are no queries. Sorry about that.
